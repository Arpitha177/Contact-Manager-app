# Contact-Manager-app
Contact Manager app by Arpitha Manda

I create the contact manager app by using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.

If a new user visit my site then login into the page by giving his name, email, and password and also he conforms his password or If an existing user he or she can use login page,  They will redirected to the contacts app

Here he can store the new contacts by adding their name, email, password

On clicking on the ADD CONTACT BUTTON a new user is added, then the available users list is visible on the right side of the screen.

If they remove all the contacts by clicking on RESET BUTTON or then can delete individual contacts by click on DELETE BUTTON
